Satellite Imagery Classifier

Project to gain familiarity with computer vision techniques, and (over time) neural network libraries.

Satellite imagery is readily available via the Google Maps API and has nice uniformity/controlability in terms of angle and scale, so I chose to build the project around those types of images. I also wanted to work with images that were not already part of a image classification dataset. This of course means that my images lack labels, so before I could start playing with neural nets I had to put together a labeling system. The code for those tasks are located in the `image_prep` directory.
